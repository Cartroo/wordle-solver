# Wordle Solver

This is a simple, and probably quite suboptimal, solver for the [Wordle game][wordle].

It's really just a small experiment to see how hard it would be to develop something that could solve the clues as optimally as possible. Although I strongly suspect this isn't optimal, it seems to generally get the correct solution within six attempts.

The quality of this code is not particularly high, as it was just a bit of a toy, but it may still be interesting to someone, hence I'm sticking it up on GitHub.
